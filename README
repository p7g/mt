mt - macOS terminal
-------------------
mt is a port of st (simple terminal) to macOS, using native Cocoa, Core Text,
and Carbon frameworks instead of X11.


Requirements
------------
macOS with Xcode Command Line Tools installed.


Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (mt is installed into the /usr/local
namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install mt (if necessary as
root):

    make clean install


Configuration
-------------
mt is configured by editing config.h and recompiling. A default config.h is
created from config.def.h on first build.


Running mt
----------
If you did not install mt with make clean install, you must compile the st
terminfo entry with the following command:

    tic -sx st.info

See the man page for additional details.
